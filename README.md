# HandReader2
A better, more improved version of HandReader. Much faster and uses a better dataset.
This was created for a Hackerspace session for CS 196.

# Getting Started #

## Requirements ##

You will need Python (2.7 Preferred) and pip installed. I do recommend a virtual enviornment, but it is not necessary.

Once you have pip, you can run:

```bash
pip install -r /path/to/this/requirements.txt
```

to install all the initial requirements for this.

Note: This installation comes with iPython.

## Branches ##
My solution is available on the solutions branch. You can check your thought process by doing so.
Otherwise, work on the master branch!
